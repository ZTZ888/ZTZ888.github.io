Hi，I'm a first year undergraduate student from Jiangxiliqong University. It is my first account which is used to document my learning, growth and projects.

My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I'm a beginner and not very familiar with various operations on GitHub.

Please take a good care of me.
